    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words using their letters. Each valid word earns the user points, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the game are as follows.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dealing**<br>\n",
    "> - A player is dealt a hand of `HAND_SIZE` letters of the alphabet, chosen at random.This may include multiple instances of a particular letter.<br>\n",
    "> - The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, but using each letter at most once.<br>\n",
    "> - Some letters may remain unused, though the size of the hand when a word is played does affect its score.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring**<br>\n",
    "> - The score for the hand is the sum of the score for each word formed.<br>\n",
    "> - The score for a word is the product of two components:\n",
    ">  - First component: the sum of the points for letters in the word.<br>\n",
    ">  - Second component: either _[7 * word_length - 3 * (n - word_length)]_ or _1_, whichever value is greater, where:<br>\n",
    ">    - `word_length` is the number of letters used in the word<br>\n",
    ">    - `n` is the number of letters available in the current hand<br>\n",
    "> - Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary `SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES` that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.<br>\n",
    "> - Examples:<br>\n",
    ">   - For example, if _n=6_ and the hand includes 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' (as well as two other letters), playing the word 'weed' would be worth 176 points: _(4+1+1+2) * (7*4 - 3*(6-4)) = 176_. The first term is the sum of the values of each letter used; the second term is the special computation that rewards a player for playing a longer word, and penalizes them for any left overletters.<br>\n",
    ">   - As another example, if _n=7_, playing the word 'it' would be worth 2 points: *(1+1) * (1) = 2*. The second component is 1 because *7*2 - 3*(7 - 2) = -1*,which is less than 1.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Started**<br>\n",
    "1. Files to be used are as follows:<br>\n",
    "> - File `ps3.py` should contain all of the code and provides a set of  procedures.<br>\n",
    "> - File `test_ps3.py` is for testing the code.<br>\n",
    "> - File `words.txt` contains the legitimate words.<br>\n",
    "2. Runing `ps3.py` loads a list of valid wordsfrom a file and then calls the `play_game` function. If everything is okay, after a small delay, you should see the following printed out:\n",
    "`Loading word list from file...`<br>\n",
    "`83667 words loaded.`<br>\n",
    "`play_game not yet implemented.`<br> \n",
    "If you see an `IOError` instead (e.g., No such file or directory), make sure you have saved `words.txt` in the same directory as `ps3.py`!<br>\n",
    "3. The file `ps3.py` has a number of already-implemented functions (Helper code).<br>\n",
    "4. In this problem set a number of modular functions were written and then glued together to form the complete game. Instead of waiting until the entire game is ready, you should test each function you write, individually, before moving on. This approach is known as **unit testing**, and it will help you debug yourcode.<br>\n",
    "5. There are several test functions to get you started. As you make progress on the problem set, run `test_ps3.py` to check your work so far. If your code passes the **unit tests** you will see a `SUCCESS` message; otherwise you will see a `FAILURE` message. These tests aren't exhaustive. You may want to test your code in other ways too (for example, with different test values) . These are the provided test functions:<br>\n",
    "> `test_get_word_score` tests the `get_word_score`<br>\n",
    "> `implementation.test_update_hand` tests the `update_hand`<br>\n",
    "> `implementation.test_is_valid_word` tests the `is_valid_word`<br>\n",
    "> `implementation.test_wildcard` testa the modifications made to support wildcards. (more about those later on)<br>\n",

    "We want to allow hands to contain wildcard letters, which will be denoted by an asterisk (*). Wildcards can only replace vowels. Each hand dealt should initially contain exactly one wildcard as one of its letters. The player does not receive any points for using the wildcard (unlike all the other letters), though it does count as a used or unused letter when scoring.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "During the game, a player wishing to use a wildcard should enter \"*\" (without quotes) instead of the intended letter.

Leave the consonant count intact, and replace one of the vowel slots with the wildcard. You will also need to modify one or more of the constants defined at the top of the file to account for wildcards.<br>\n",
