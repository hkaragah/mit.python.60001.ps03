    "### Problem Set 3, Part 2: Dealing with hands (scroll down)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This game is a lot like Scrabble or Words With Friends. Letters are dealt to players, who then construct one or more words using their letters. Each valid word earns the user points, based on the length of the word and the letters in that word.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the game are as follows.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dealing**<br>\n",
    "> - A player is dealt a hand of `HAND_SIZE` letters of the alphabet, chosen at random.This may include multiple instances of a particular letter.<br>\n",
    "> - The player arranges the hand into as many words as they want out of the letters, but using each letter at most once.<br>\n",
    "> - Some letters may remain unused, though the size of the hand when a word is played does affect its score.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring**<br>\n",
    "> - The score for the hand is the sum of the score for each word formed.<br>\n",
    "> - The score for a word is the product of two components:\n",
    ">  - First component: the sum of the points for letters in the word.<br>\n",
    ">  - Second component: either _[7 * word_length - 3 * (n - word_length)]_ or _1_, whichever value is greater, where:<br>\n",
    ">    - `word_length` is the number of letters used in the word<br>\n",
    ">    - `n` is the number of letters available in the current hand<br>\n",
    "> - Letters are scored as in Scrabble; A is worth 1, B is worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on. We have defined the dictionary `SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES` that maps each lowercase letter to its Scrabble letter value.<br>\n",
    "> - Examples:<br>\n",
    ">   - For example, if _n=6_ and the hand includes 1 'w', 2 'e's, and 1 'd' (as well as two other letters), playing the word 'weed' would be worth 176 points: _(4+1+1+2) * (7*4 - 3*(6-4)) = 176_. The first term is the sum of the values of each letter used; the second term is the special computation that rewards a player for playing a longer word, and penalizes them for any left overletters.<br>\n",
    ">   - As another example, if _n=7_, playing the word 'it' would be worth 2 points: *(1+1) * (1) = 2*. The second component is 1 because *7*2 - 3*(7 - 2) = -1*,which is less than 1.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Started**<br>\n",
    "1. Files to be used are as follows:<br>\n",
    "> - File `ps3.py` should contain all of the code and provides a set of  procedures.<br>\n",
    "> - File `test_ps3.py` is for testing the code.<br>\n",
    "> - File `words.txt` contains the legitimate words.<br>\n",
    "2. Runing `ps3.py` loads a list of valid wordsfrom a file and then calls the `play_game` function. If everything is okay, after a small delay, you should see the following printed out:\n",
    "`Loading word list from file...`<br>\n",
    "`83667 words loaded.`<br>\n",
    "`play_game not yet implemented.`<br> \n",
    "If you see an `IOError` instead (e.g., No such file or directory), make sure you have saved `words.txt` in the same directory as `ps3.py`!<br>\n",
    "3. The file `ps3.py` has a number of already-implemented functions (Helper code).<br>\n",
    "4. In this problem set a number of modular functions were written and then glued together to form the complete game. Instead of waiting until the entire game is ready, you should test each function you write, individually, before moving on. This approach is known as **unit testing**, and it will help you debug yourcode.<br>\n",
    "5. There are several test functions to get you started. As you make progress on the problem set, run `test_ps3.py` to check your work so far. If your code passes the **unit tests** you will see a `SUCCESS` message; otherwise you will see a `FAILURE` message. These tests aren't exhaustive. You may want to test your code in other ways too (for example, with different test values) . These are the provided test functions:<br>\n",
    "> `test_get_word_score` tests the `get_word_score`<br>\n",
    "> `implementation.test_update_hand` tests the `update_hand`<br>\n",
    "> `implementation.test_is_valid_word` tests the `is_valid_word`<br>\n",
    "> `implementation.test_wildcard` testa the modifications made to support wildcards. (more about those later on)<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "**Representing hands**<br>\n",
    "A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random letters. For example, the player could start out with the following hand: **a, q, l, m, u, i, l**. In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary: the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand. For example, the above hand would be represented as:<br>\n",
    "> `hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the repeated letter `'l'` is represented. With a dictionary representation, the usual way to access a value is `hand['a']`, where `'a'` is the key we want to find. However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get a `KeyError`. To avoid this,we can instead use the function call `hand.get('a',0)`. This is the **\"safe\"** way to access avalue if we are not sure the key is in the dictionary. `d.get(key,default)` returns the value for key if key is in the dictionary `d` , else it returns `default`. If `default` is not given, it returns `None`, so that this method never raises a `KeyError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Converting words into dictionary representation**<br>\n",
    "One useful function, that is already defined, is `get_frequency_dict`, defined near the top of `ps3.py`. When given a string of letters as an input, it returns a dictionary where the keys are letters and the values are the number of times that letter is represented in the input string. For example:<br>\n",
    "> `>>get_frequency_dict(\"hello\")`<br>\n",
    "`{'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 1}`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, this is the same kind of dictionary we use to represent hands.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Displaying a hand**<br>\n",
    "Given a hand represented as a dictionary, to display it in a user-friendly way, `display_hand function` is provided.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generating a random hand**<br>\n",
    "The hand a player is dealt is a set of letters chosen at random. A function that generates a random hand, `deal_hand`, is already provided. The function takes as input a positive integer _n_, and returns a new dictionary representing a hand of _n_ lowercase letters.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Removing letters from a hand (you implement this!)**<br>\n",
    "The player starts with a full hand of _n_ letters. As the player spells out words, letters from the set are used up. For example, the player could start with the following hand: **a, q, l, m, u, i, l** The player could choose to play the word *please **quail**. This would leave the following letters in the player's hand: **l, m**. You will now write a function that takes a hand and a word as inputs, uses letters from that hand to spell the word, and returns a new hand containing only the remaining letters. Your function should not modify the input hand. For example:<br>\n",
    "> `>>hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}`<br>\n",
    "`>>display_hand(hand)`<br>\n",
    "`a q l l m u i`<br>\n",
    "`>>new_hand = update_hand(hand, 'quail')`<br>\n",
    "`>>new_hand{'l': 1, 'm': 1}`<br>\n",
    "`>>display_hand(new_hand) l m`>br>\n",
    "`>>display_hand(hand) a q l l m u i`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "(**NOTE:** Alternatively, in the above example, after the call to `update_hand` the value of `new_hand` could be the dictionary `{'a':0, 'q':0, 'l':1, 'm':1, 'u':0, 'i':0}`. The exact value depends on your implementation; but the output of `display_hand()` should be the same in either case.)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** If the player guesses a word that is invalid, either because it is not a real word or because they used letters that they don't actually have in their hand, they still lose the letters from their hand that they did guess as a penalty. Make sure that your implementation accounts for this! Do not assume that the word you are given only uses letters that actually exist in the hand. For example:<br>\n",
    "> `>>hand = {'j':2, 'o':1, 'l':1, 'w':1, 'n':2}`<br> `>>display_hand(hand) j j o l w n n`<br>\n",
    "`>>hand = update_hand(hand, 'jolly')`<br>\n",
    "`>>hand{'j':1, w':1, 'n':2}`<br>\n",
    "`>>display_hand(hand) j w n n`<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one 'j', one 'o', and one 'l' (despite that facts that the player tried to use two, because only one existed in the hand) were used up. The 'y' guess has no effect on the hand, because 'y' was not in the hand to begin with. Also, the same note from above about alternate representations of the hand applies here.<br>\n",
    "Implement the `update_hand` function according to the specifications in the skeleton code.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT:** You may wish to review the documentation for the \"` .copy `\" method of Python dictionaries.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing:** Make sure the `test_update_hand tests` pass. You may also want to test your implementation of `update_hand` with some reasonable inputs.<br>\n",
